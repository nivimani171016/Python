#Create a variable, b, and assign it the value of 15. Then, write code to see if the value b is greater than that of a. If it is, aâ€™s value should be multiplied by 2. If the value of b is less than or equal to a, nothing should happen. Finally, create variable c and assign it the value of the sum of a and b.
a = 20
b = 15
if b>a:
    a = a*2
else:
    a = 20
    b = 15
c = a + b
print(c)
